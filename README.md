# silent-aim-payday2-superblt

I didn't write the lua I just cobbled together a mod to be loaded by super blt for current version payday2 9/23/2022


put into folder titled "silent" in the mods folder. Go into mod keybinds option in options menu within payday2 to set the keybind. It only runs during an active match so pressing the key in menu does nothing. Sometimes you have to re-enable it between games.

SuperBLT 3.3.3 required. Here's the DL link I used. USE AT OWN RISK. I DON'T OWN OR MAKE SUPER BLT. I read it's possible to corrupt your save when using it although extremely rare.
